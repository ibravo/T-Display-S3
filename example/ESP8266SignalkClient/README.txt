Yes, you'd have to make a Data Connection with data type 'SignalK',
Signalk Source 'UDP', port '30330'.
Of course you can change the port number, but then you'd also need
 to change the sketch accordingly.
 You need to do that anyway to change the wifi credentials and server
  address to your own. (edited)
